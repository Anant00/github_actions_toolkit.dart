# github_actions_toolkit

A third-party toolkit for [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) coded in Dart. It is inspired by the official Javascript [`actions/toolkit`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/) and contains similar commands.

Check out this ["Hello World" Action](https://github.com/axel-op/hello-world-dart-action) for an example of a Dart GitHub Action.
